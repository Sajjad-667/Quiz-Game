# Quiz Game 🎮

This is a **simple quiz game** implemented in Python using basic control structures like `if-else` and `for` loops.

## Features
- Asks the user 3 questions
- Provides immediate feedback on whether the answer is correct or not
- Displays the final score at the end

## Questions Included
1. What is the capital of France?
2. What is 5 + 7?
3. What color is the sky on a clear day?

## How It Works
- Each question is stored in a dictionary with the correct answer.
- The program loops through each question and prompts the user to enter an answer.
- It compares the user input (converted to lowercase) to the correct answer.
- Correct answers increase the user's score.
